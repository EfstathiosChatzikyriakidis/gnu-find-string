How to read this manual
***********************

   To read this manual, begin at the beginning, reading from left to
right and top to bottom, until you get to the end. Then stop. You may
pause for a beer anywhere in the middle as well, if you wish.

   (Please note, however, that The King strongly advises against heavy
use of prescription pharmaceuticals, based on his extensive personal
and professional experience.)

Overview
********

   The GNU fs searches the named input `FILEs', standard input (if no
files are named), or environment variable `GFS_INPUT' for lines
containing a match to the given `PATTERN'. By default, GNU fs prints
the matching lines.

   GNU fs is *protected* by the GNU General Public License.

   GNU fs was written by Efstathios Chatzikyriakidis.

Invoking
********

The format for running the `gfs' program is:

   `gfs [OPTIONS] -e PATTERN [FILE...]'

The `gfs' program supports the following options:

`--reverse-match'
`-r'
     Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

`--max-matches'
`-m'
     Show the max number of matches within a file.

`--line-number'
`-n'
     Prefix each line with a number.

`--ignore-case'
`-i'
     Ignore case distinctions.

`--pattern=PATTERN'
`-e PATTERN'
     Use PATTERN as the pattern.

`--verbose'
`-v'
     Explain what is being done.

`--help'
     Display a short help and exit.

`--usage'
     Same as `--help' option.

`--version'
     Print version information and exit.

`--author'
     Print author information and exit.

`--copyleft'
     Print the short version of GNU/GPL and exit.

Environment Variables
*********************

The behavior of gfs is affected by the following environment variables.

`GFS_INPUT'
     Specifies the input file.

Diagnostics

Normally, exit status is 0 if selected lines are found and 1 otherwise.
But the exit status is 2 if an error occurred.
