GNU fs -- `INSTALL' starts here.

Install:

  If you want to install or uninstall the program you must first
  use a shell. Next, be sure that your current working directory
  is the `src' directory.

  You can perform this by using the `pwd' and `cd' commands.

  Now, you can run the `install-gui.sh' or 'install-nox.sh' shell
  script depending on your inteface. If you select the graphical
  installation script, you must have `zenity' package installed.

  Also, you should have superuser privileges.

  Run the appropriate installation shell script:

    $ ./install-gui.sh (for gui mode).
    $ ./install-nox.sh (for text-based mode).

  When the select list appear, select the appropriate option.

  Happy Hacking!
